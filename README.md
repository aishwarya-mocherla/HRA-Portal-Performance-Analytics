# HRA-Portal-Performance-Analytics

The Human Reference Atlas (HRA) Portal Analytics project aims to develop a Power BI dashboard to analyze user interactions with the HRA portal. Using Google Analytics log data, the dashboard will provide insights into:

Most visited pages and patterns in user engagement.
Unique visitor count and geographical distribution of users.
Trends in interactions with key portal sections, including 2D/3D Reference Objects, ASCT+B Tables, OMAPs, tools, and training resources.
The dataset consists of Google Analytics logs in a CSV format, with fields like user IDs, timestamps, URLs, and event details. Queries will be processed via BigQuery, enabling detailed analysis and visualization in Power BI.

The final dashboard will help understand user behavior, content popularity, and engagement trends, guiding improvements for better user experience and outreach.
